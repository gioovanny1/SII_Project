# SII_Project

SII_Project is a project carried out by Giovanny Jaramillo PÃ©rez, a student of the Master's in Computer Engineering and Networks at the Polytechnic University of Valencia, which consists of image recognition using TinyML. 
Among the images to be recognized are: people walking, on scooters, and riding bicycles.

## Before starting

This project includes a directory and a compressed file (.zip), and both are used to upload the code to the board. The first one (sii-project-esp32-20) contains the necessary code for uploading to the board using the Edge Impulse 
firmware, and the second contains the necessary code for uploading from the Arduino IDE. In this case, the deployment has been made for an ESP-EYE board, manufactured by Espressif Systems.
